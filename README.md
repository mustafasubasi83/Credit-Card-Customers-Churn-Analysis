## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
The goal of this notebook is to answer both tasks given for the "Credit Card Customers" - dataset.

The first goal of this project is to provide an analysis which shows the difference between a non-churning and churning customer. 
This will provide us insight into which customers are eager to churn.

The top priority of this case is to identify if a customer will churn or won't. It's important that we don't predict churning as non-churning customers. 
That's why the model needs to be evaluated on the "Recall"- metric (goal > 62%).

**Business and Data Understandig Questions:**

> How many customers have some attrition with the bank?

> How demographic variables are impact to earger the churn?

> How are the relationship with the variables vs churn?

> What are the diffirences between Non Churn and Churn Profiles?

> Who's gonna churn?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. 
Markdown cells & comments were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
BankChurners.csv       - The data set has 10,000 customers with attributes such as age, salary, marital status, credit limit, card category, among others. There are approximately 18 features in the whole set and there are only 16.0% of customers with churn
